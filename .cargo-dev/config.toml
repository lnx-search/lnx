# This configuration makes it possible to use mold
# as the linker for rustc.
#
# I recommended it for development as it really improves performance. 
# 
# To enable
# - install clang
# - install mold https://github.com/rui314/mold into /usr/local/bin/mold
# - add a symbolic link from .cargo -> .cargo-dev 
# via `ln -s .cargo-dev .cargo`.
#
# If there is an issue, reverting is as simple as deleting .cargo.
